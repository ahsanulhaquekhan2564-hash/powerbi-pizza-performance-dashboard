# Power BI Dashboard — Pizza Performance Analytics

End-to-end Power BI project built on a **synthetic dataset** to mirror real-world BI workflows: data prep → star schema modeling → DAX measures → interactive dashboard design.

## Goal
Create a business-ready reporting dashboard to monitor:
- revenue & cost performance
- product and ingredient profitability
- customer behavior and marketing insights
- operational trends over time

## What I built
- **Star schema data model** (orders, customers, products/ingredients, calendar + bridge tables)
- One-to-many relationships and validated model behavior
- **DAX KPI measures** (e.g., Turnover, Total Cost, Contribution Margin, AOV, New vs Returning Customers, time-based trends)
- 3 report pages with consistent UI:
  1) Business Review KPI
  2) Pizza Performance KPI
  3) Customer & Marketing Insight
- Slicers, tooltips, drill-style exploration, and cross-highlighting for usability
