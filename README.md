# Power BI Dashboard — Pizza Performance Analytics

End-to-end Power BI project built on a **synthetic dataset** to mirror real-world BI workflows: **data preparation → star schema modeling → DAX measures → interactive dashboard design**.

## Goal
Create a business-ready reporting dashboard to monitor:
- revenue & cost performance
- product and ingredient profitability
- customer behavior and marketing insights
- operational trends over time

## What I built
- **Star schema data model** (orders, customers, products/ingredients, calendar + bridge/lookup tables)
- One-to-many relationships and validated model behavior (filter flow + cross-highlighting)
- **DAX KPI measures**, including:
  - Turnover, Total Cost, Contribution Margin
  - AOV
  - New vs Returning Customers
  - time-based trends and segmentation views
- **3 report pages** with consistent UI and slicers:
  1) Business Review KPI
  2) Pizza Performance KPI
  3) Customer & Marketing Insight
- Interactive elements: slicers, tooltips, cross-filtering/cross-highlighting, and drill-style exploration
